### Introduction

### Chapter 1: Setting Up Your Coding Environment

* **Page 3: Downloading Code and Data from GitHub**

> The GitHub folder name has been renamed to `practical-sql-2-main` from `practical-sql-2-master` in line with GitHub conventions. (Applies to first printing of the book.)

* **Page 13: pgAdmin Dialog to Create Server**

> The location of the pgAdmin dialog to add a server has changed. Now, in the object browser, right-click `Servers` and then click `Register` > `Server`. The remaining steps in the Note on page 13 are the same. (Formerly, the dialog was accessed by right-clicking `Servers` and selecting `Create` > `Server`.) (Applies to first printing of the book.)

* **Page 15, Figure 1-5: pgAdmin Query Tool**

> Version 6.9 of pgAdmin, released in May 2022, introduced a redesigned Query Tool Layout. General functionality is the same, but if you are using version 6.9 or later, you will see that some menu icons shown in the book at the top of the window are now placed atop the results grid. (Applies to first printing of the book.)

### Chapter 10: Inspecting and Modifying Data

* **Page 180: Improving Performance When Updating Large Tables**

> The second statement in Listing 10-26 renames the copy we made with Listing 10-25 to the original name of the table. The text incorrectly says we are renaming the copy made in Listing 10-24.

### Chapter 11: Statistical Functions in SQL

### Chapter 13: Advanced Query Techniques

* No updates

### Chapter 14: Mining Text to Find Meaningful Data

* **Pages 253, etc.: Turning Text to Data with Regular Expression Functions**

> The dates of crimes in this section are in the format MM/DD/YY. If your database has a `datestyle` setting other than `MDY` -- for example if you're in Europe -- then you will likely need to set your `datestyle` to complete the examples.

> Check your `datestyle` by running this query in pgAdmin:

```
SHOW datestyle;
```

> If the result is other than `ISO, MDY`, you can set the `datestyle` on a per-session basis by running this command:

```
SET datestyle to "ISO, MDY";
```
> You can then complete the examples. The change will persist until you restart pgAdmin.

* **Page 267: Creating a Table for Full-Text Search** 

> The `COPY` statement in Listing 14-18 uses an at-sign (@) for quoting, not an ampersand. 


### Chapter 15: Analyzing Spatial Data with PostGIS

* **Pages 282, etc.: Geometry Viewer Results Grid Icon**

> Beginning with version 6.9 of pgAdmin, released in May 2022, the icon to launch the Geometry Viewer in the result column header was changed from an eye to a map (makes sense). On Page 282 and later in the book, I mention clicking the eye icon to launch the viewer. Now, instead, click the map icon. (Applies to first printing of the book.)
